x2pgui is a quick hack of x2vnc to replace the VNC functionality
with a PicoGUI remote input driver. The original readme for x2vnc
follows...

                   x2vnc - A dual-screen hack
          Written by Fredrik Hübinette <hubbe@hubbe.net>
         Based on ideas from x2x and code from vncviewer.

          Thanks to Grant McDorman and Brad Fitzpatrick
            for helping me make this program better.


This program merges the capabilities of x2x and vncviewer.
It will allow a machine with an X display and a machine with
a VNC server running on it's main screen to act as if they
were two displays connected to one machine. When you move
your mouse pointer off the screen in a direction of your
choosing, the pointer will appear on the other screen instead.

To compile x2vmc, execute the commands 'xmkmf' and then 'make'.
The latest version of this program should be available from
