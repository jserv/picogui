aqw - Agenda Quikwriting

Based on Quikwrite (http://mrl.nyu.edu/projects/quikwriting/) it's
another way to input text to the Agenda.  The main entry method 
more or less follows Quikwriting, with enhancements for easier
Return, Tab, and Backspace key handling.  Each of the 8 zones used
by Quickwriting also accept single-tap input, allowing use of Ctrl
and Alt keys combinations as well.

Right now it doesn't have proper function key (F1 - F12) handling, 
as I can't concoct an elegant way to work it in.  If necessary, we
could always hack in a droplist that lets you select a key.

As usual, if you use this it's at your own risk.  If you try aqw
and your cat bursts into flames lemme know (I have a neighbor with
an unruly animal...) ;-)
