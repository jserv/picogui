1. How do I enable identd in X-Chat?

   Identd isn't actually apart of X-Chat. You will need to download and install 
   your own ident server. Most distributions, including RedHat, come with an 
   ident server program called pidentd. Make sure it is enabled in
   /etc/inetd.conf or read you distribution's documentation.

   As an alternative, you can try this experimental identd server: xchat_auth
   http://xchat.org/auth/


2. How do I auto join more than 1 channel with keys?

   In the Serverlist's channel column enter multiple channels and separate 
   them by commas, eg:  "#linux,#warez,#chat". Do not put spaces between the
   channels. If the channels also have keys (passwords), then the syntax is:
   "#channel1,#channel2,#channel3 key1,key2,key3"


3. How do I autoconnect and join a channel when X-Chat loads?

   In the Serverlist's Edit Window, check the checkbox "Autoconnect"
   of the entries you want to auto-connect/join. When you restart xchat
   it should automatically connect to these servers, and join the channels.


4. How do I cut and paste in X-Chat?

   It's exactly the same as any other X application. You simply mark the text
   you want, and then press middle mouse button to paste (if you only have a
   2 button mouse, press left&right buttons at once). 


5. How do I connect through a proxy?

   Go to the menus, Settings -> Setup -> Proxy Server and fill in the requested
   information there (version 1.6.x or above only). This is currently no
   support for using a username and password to authenticate to the proxy.


6. I get this error: /bin/sh: no: command not found

   Making all in po
   make[2]: Entering directory `/sec/Programme/xchat-1.4.0/po'
   file=./`echo cs | sed 's,.*/,,'`.gmo \
     && rm -f $file && PATH=../src:$PATH no -o $file cs.po
   /bin/sh: no: command not found
   make[2]: *** [cs.gmo] Error 127
   make[2]: Leaving directory `/sec/Programme/xchat-1.4.0/po'
   make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
   make[1]: Leaving directory `/sec/Programme/xchat-1.4.0'
   make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2

   This means you don't have GNU gettext installed. Either install it, or do
   ./configure --disable-nls (nls/gettext is for foreign language support).


7. Why does X-Chat open a listen port?

   Normally, X-Chat will not open a listen port, unless you are offering
   a file by DCC. If you compiled X-Chat with the --enable-panel option,
   ORBit (a library that is apart of Gnome) will open a port. X-Chat cannot
   prevent this. If it really bothers you, compile X-Chat with
   --disable-panel.


8. Why is the "Tint Transparency" option shaded out?

   It means you've compiled without gdk-pixbuf available. The configure script
   looks for gdk-pixbuf-config to find out if you have it installed. On a
   redhat or mandrake system you should have something like:

      $ rpm -qa | grep gdk-pix
      gdk-pixbuf-0.11.0
      gdk-pixbuf-devel-0.11.0

   The "devel" package is also necessary! You should be able to find these
   packages on your Linux CDROM or local GNOME ftp site. Once you install
   gdk-pixbuf, try recompiling xchat.


9. How do I set different ban types?

   Three ways:

      Right click the nickname in the userlist, and choose a bantype from the
      "Kick/Ban" submenu. This menu is only available by default in version
      1.6.x or above. You can also do it manually:

         /ban <nick> <bantype>

      where the <bantype> is a number from 0 to 3.

         /set ban_type <bantype>

      sets the default ban type to use for all bans. The different types are:

        0 *!*@*.host
        1 *!*@domain
        2 *!*user@*.host
        3 *!*user@domain


10. Why doesn't ./configure find GTK+ on my FreeBSD system?

   FreeBSD usually comes with glib12-config and gtk12-config, so you'll need
   to setenv them:

       setenv GLIB_CONFIG /usr/local/bin/glib12-config
       setenv GTK_CONFIG /usr/X11R6/bin/gtk12-config
       rm config.cache
       ./configure


11. Why can't I see accented-letters/umlauts/upper-ascii-chars in X-Chat?

   Firstly, you should disable fontsets. The setting is in Settings ->
   Setup -> Channel Windows -> Use a FontSet. There is no reason to have
   this setting ON, unless you know you need it. Some versions of X-Chat
   require a restart for this setting to take affect.
   If that doesn't fix the problem, try using a different font, some
   fonts simply don't have the characters you want.
