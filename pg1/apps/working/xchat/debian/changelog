  * Added alias.pl and unban.pl in /usr/share/doc/xchat-common/scripts-perl,
    thanks to Vetinari <iranitev@gmx.net>
  * These memory leaks aren't reproducible by me, upstream author and other
    people, so they're probably related with specific kernel/configuration;
    closes: #107076, #105335.
  * This isn't true, it doesn't require an extra press; closes: #106044.
  * Now struct module_cmd_set *mod_cmds' isn't static; closes: #106848.
  * Upstream author said:
    "I just dont check them, if you run out of memory, it mayaswell just
     crash; besides, all os'es have virtual memory and mallocs hardly ever
     fail. If you dont have enough memory to alloca the TINNY amounts xchat
     allocates, there wont be enough memory to make an error message anyway"
    closes: #106942.
  * Now our default terminal is x-terminal-emulator; closes: #107784, #107789.
    Thanks to Eduard Bloch <edi@gmx.de>
  * Well, now this is the normal behaviour; an easy workaround could be this:
    make a UserCommand, Name "myreconnect" Command "/join 0 /reconnect"
    Try to use alias.pl (/usr/share/doc/xchat-common/scripts-perl/alias.pl)
  * Sorry, I prefer to use conflicts between xchat and xchat-gnome packages
    because xchat-text isn't very used like the other two. closes: #98773.
  * Ircd doesn't support PRIVMSG #chan1,#chan2; closes: #100757.
  * Upstream author's words:
    <zed> 104768- this is wishlist, i guess he should mail me about this..
    or create a patch.. the plugin interface is very rarely used (and not
    changed in 1+ years).
    closes: #104768.

  * Now actions cause a beep for PM windows (if you enable it).
    Patch provided by Richard Fuchs <dfx@gmx.at>; closes: #78484.
  * After a discussion with upstream author I've decided to remove
    panel applet support from xchat-gnome package; Peter said that
    "it's not really a maintained piece of code" and I think that it's
    useless to provide a broken applet (of course if someone would like
    to take care of code I'll readd it.) closes: #82113, #84723, #84729.
  * Now messaging channels or nicknames works a bit like in mIRC now,
    i.e. when there's an open tab for the destination, the message shows
    up there (usefull for logs); closes: #60104.
    Patch provided by Richard Fuchs <dfx@gmx.at>.
  * Peter's words:
    "<zed> #69765 - with the suggested solution the client could be too
    easily fooled by people having some fun :) xchat doesnt "handle"
    netsplits anyway, it just prints out what the server says."
    "<zed> the netsplit message is no different to a quitmessage unluckily".
    closes: #69765.
  * Peter dixit: "thats the way it is", it's not a bug but, a feature.
    closes: #78494.

    closes: #79647, #81385.
  * That perl script isn't included into xchat upstream tarball and we don't know
    what it should do, submitter doesn't provide any other info, so we can close
    it; closes: #79641.
  * xchat doesn't come with a en_DK po, anyway it should ignore it; I tried to
    export en_DK and I used xchat 1.6.3 both with and without libc6-i686:
    it works. closes: #78710.

  * Includes patch for fkeys.c (Closes: #58957).
  * Problem with unexpected /nick behaviour fixed. (Closes: #53623)
  * Unfortunately, to resolve #47343, I would need release n+1 versions
    for each language. In the meantime, it's possible to override the
    English autocomplete words by doing Settings -> Replace Popup - Delete 
    All. In the meantime, I'm going to close this bug. If you feel the
    need to dicuss it further, don't hesitate mailing me. (Closes: #47343)
  * Adam Klein split xchat{-gnome,-text} into xchat-common, xchat,
