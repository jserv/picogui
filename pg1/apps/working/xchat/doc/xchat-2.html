<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Getting</A>
 </H2>

<P>If you re lazy, or don't want to install any support libraries then Peter
Alexandrou has started hosting the 
<A HREF="http://www.users.bigpond.com/redowl/xchat/">X-Chat static binary webpage</A><P>The main distribution point for XChat is 
<A HREF="http://xchat.linuxpower.org">the XChat homepage</A>, XChat also needs 
<A HREF="http://www.gtk.org">GTK</A>. Optionally
XChat can use 
<A HREF="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.perl.com">Perl</A>.
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Building</A>
 </H2>

<P>XChat uses the GNU autoconf system, so building it is quite easy, for most
systems the auto detection will work:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
./configure ; make ; su ; make install
 
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>On some systems gmake might be needed rather than make.
<P>The configure script can be passed some options as well
<P>
<UL>
<LI>--disable-perl = Disables Perl support</LI>
<LI>--disable-gnome = Disables GNOME support</LI>
</UL>
<P>Be aware that if you don't have perl or GNOME the configure script will
pick this up and you don't need to pass these options, they are only if for
when you do have them, but don't want support for them.
<P>If you are having problems with this method you can try the old method:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
cp Makefile.gtk Makefile ; make ; su ; make install
 
</PRE>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Running</A>
 </H2>

<P>The build process makes a binary called xchat. If you installed it typing
xchat at the console should run it, if not cd into the XChat directory and
type ./xchat
<P>The directory ~/.xchat should be created for you, XChat uses this
directory to store per-user settings and logs.
