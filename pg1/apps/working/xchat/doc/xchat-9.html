<P>Many others helped with other changes. If you submitted a patch and want
your name included here, let zed@linuxpower.org know

<P>Peter Zelezny (AKA: zed) puts together all the patches into one (hopefully)
complete whole. He controls the web site and all 'real' releases of XChat come
from him. He also handles the Freshmeat and GNOME AppList announcements. Anything
in the ChangeLog without a name by it is usually his work. His e-mail address
is zed@linuxpower.org.
<P>Adam Langley (AKA: Nebulae) (that's me) handles the documentation and chunks
of the code, mostly the signals and plugin code. Releases from me (just ask
me for them on elitenet,#linux) are not 'real' releases and are not always
stable.
<P>Other people chip in code and ideas from time to time, mostly to zed, on
Elitenet,#linux.
<P>Patches should be mailed to Peter only unless it's against one of my releases.
If you need advice or help on XChat firstly look though this document then
ask someone on Elitenet,#linux - but beware the people on #linux are
not support staff, they may just laugh at you ;)
