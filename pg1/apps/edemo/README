This is a little demo app for PicoGUI.

The idea is stolen from pgdemo.py: parse the template pages in the
"templates" directory and display them in a box widget.

Furthermore there are some special widgets names which enable you to
simply embed some action in the displayed page.

So far I stole canvastst, chaos_fire, dialogdemo, menudemo, pterm, and
themebar embedding them in the pages.

Just try it out and look for the widgets named EDH* in the templates
files. The list of names is in special.c.

Before running it compile the themes and put some picogui application
under the directory "apps". Also put some themes under the "*themes"
directories:

bgthemes     <- bg_*.th themes
cursorthemes <- crsr_*.th themes
fullthemes   <- aqua.th, nifty3d.th, ...
miscthemes   <- mod_*.th themes

It should be easy to study the code and extend it. I tried to keep it
simple.
