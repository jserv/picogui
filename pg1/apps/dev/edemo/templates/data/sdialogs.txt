One of PicoGUI main peculiarity is the absence of overlapping windows. This is the design choice that makes PicoGUI lightweight and fast.

Anyway PicoGUI implements a number of "popup" interactive windows that freeze the display when invoked. Try the buttons below.

Also try the mod_ themes that modify the popup windows behaviour.
