uSpread:
========

uSpread is a micro spread sheet application developed for
PicoGUI (http://pgui.sourceforge.net/).

It should run on any supported platform but the design
is more biased towards handheld devices ;)

It basically reads CSV (comma seperated format) files, but:

* first row is used as column headers that don't scroll, also sets max columns
* second row is used as column widths
* there should be no extra linefeeds at the end of file
