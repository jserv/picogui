This directory includes documentation for PicoGUI 1

Much of this is automatically generated by the Makefile
and scripts it invokes. The generated documentation is
included here also, as a convenience. To generate the
documentation yourself, you will need many tools,
including AT&T Graphviz, Doxygen, jadetex, and docbook.
