These fonts were converted from X11 fonts to BDF using fstobdf. (Except for
console8, which was converted from Linux's gr8x8 console font)

The .fi file defines a font style, containing one or more actual fonts.
(Normal, bold, etc.) The actual fonts use the standard .bdf format.
fontdef.pl converts the .fi and .bdf files into a C source file with font
structures.

Example: to generate the clean8.bdf file, do:
  fstobdf -s :7100 -fn "-*-clean-medium-r-*-*-*-80-*-*-*-*-*-*" > clean8.bdf
