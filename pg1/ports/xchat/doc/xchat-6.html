<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Windows</A> </H2>

<P>These windows can be accessed from the Windows menu
<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Channel List</A>
 </H2>

<P>This window allows you to list all the channels on the server. The channels
are filtered to only list channels with at least the number of users given
in &quot;Minimum Users&quot;. &quot;Refresh the list&quot; clears the list
and re-runs the search. &quot;Save the list&quot; allows you to write the
list to a file while &quot;Join Channel&quot; joins you to the selected channel
in the list.
<P>Be aware that there can be thousands of channels and listing them can flood
the connection. The only way to stop a running list is to disconnect.
<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 DCC Send and DCC Receive</A>
 </H2>

<P>These windows show the status of all running DCC sends and receives. &quot;Status&quot;
shows the status of the file. &quot;File&quot; gives the file name. &quot;Size&quot;
gives the size, in bytes, of the file. &quot;Position&quot; gives the number
of currently send of received bytes. &quot;Ack&quot; (only in Send) gives
the number of acknowledged bytes. &quot;CPS&quot; gives the number of bytes
sent/recv'ed per second. &quot;From&quot; gives the nickname of the sending
or receiving person. If you have GNOME then you also have a column with the
MIME type of the file.
<P>The &quot;Abort&quot; button kills the send or receive while &quot;Info&quot;
gives some extra information about the transaction.
<P>Only in the Receive window are the &quot;Accept&quot; and &quot;Resume&quot;
buttons. &quot;Accept&quot; accepts an offered file, while &quot;Resume&quot;
does the same but continues a broken transaction. 
<P>The text of items in the DCC windows is now color coded with the state
of the transaction.
<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 DCC Chat</A>
 </H2>

<P>The DCC Chat window list all current DCC chat sessions. &quot;To/From&quot;
gives the nick of the other peer. &quot;Recv&quot; gives the number of bytes
received on the DCC link and &quot;Send&quot; gives the number of bytes sent.
&quot;StartTime&quot; gives the time the link was opened.
<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 Raw Log</A>
 </H2>

<P>The Raw Log window lists the raw data sent to, and received from, the server.
Each new line of data is prefixed with either &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot; or &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;.
A &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot; means the rest of the line (after the space) was data
to from XChat to the server, &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; means the rest of the line
(after the space) was data sent from the server to XChat. You can also hit
Alt-s to save the rawlog - you will be prompted for a file name
<H2><A NAME="ss6.5">6.5 URL Grabber</A>
 </H2>

<P>When an URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is seen in any window, it is placed
in the URL Grabber list. This saves cutting and pasting from the window. The
&quot;Clear&quot; button wipes the list. The &quot;Lynx&quot; and &quot;Netscape&quot;
start lynx or netscape with the selected URL from the list.
<H2><A NAME="ss6.6">6.6 Notify List</A>
 </H2>

<P>The notify list uses the ISON command to find any &quot;friends&quot;
that may be on IRC. You use the /notify command to add and remove people from
the list (it's a toggle function), then the notify list shows which of them
are on, and which server they are using. The &quot;Remove&quot; button removes
the currently selected nick form the notify list.
<H2><A NAME="ss6.7">6.7 Lastlog</A>
 </H2>

<P>The Lastlog window allows you to search past text in the current window.
Type in the search parameters (straight grep) into the text box at the bottom
and the data in the current log is searched and all matching lines are written
to the text box.
<H2><A NAME="ss6.8">6.8 Ignore</A>
 </H2>

<P>This window controls XChat's ignore engine. This (as the name suggests)
lets you setup rules to ignore people's messages. These rules are based on
a host mask and a mask of what to ignore. The mask is in the format of Nickname!realname@host,
so *!*@*.aol.com matches everyone on AOL and LameNick!*@* would match anyone
with the nick of LameNick. The row of buttons along the middle gives the MASK
of what to ignore:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>CTCP - All CTCP messages (DCC Send, CTCP Ping etc)</LI>
<LI>Private - All /msg's from them</LI>
<LI>Channel - All channel messages from them</LI>
<LI>Notice - All /notice messages from them</LI>
<LI>Invite - All invite messages from them</LI>
<LI>Unignore - Inverts the mask so you can ban *!*@*.aol.com then unignore.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The text boxes along the bottom show the number of times a certain type
of message has been blocked. The unignore engine can also be accessed from
the command line:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
/ignore *!*@*.aol.com ALL /ignore myfriend!myfriend@*.aol.com ALL UNIGNORE (Would ignore everyone on AOL except myfriend).
