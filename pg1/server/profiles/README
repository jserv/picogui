This directory contains sample configurations to optimize pgserver for a
particular target platform. The profile.* files are compile-time
configurations that can be loaded using something like:
  
  ./configure --with-profile=profiles/profile.foo
  
You may still customize these settings using 'make menuconfig' if needed.

The *.conf files are sample runtime configurations for various platforms.
Where the compile-time options turn on and off various features, the runtime
options set paths and configure default values for drivers. See
README.configfile for more information on the settings available in the
configuration files. pgserver will look for runtime configuration at
/etc/pgserver.conf, ~/.pgserverrc, or on the command line.
