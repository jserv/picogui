PicoGUI Server 
-----------------

PicoGUI is designed to be a small, efficient, portable, scalable GUI. It
works on various types of systems, including many embedded systems. It has
a unique client/server architecture. This is the server portion.

There is a list of contributors in the AUTHORS file

There's also an IRC channel, #picogui on irc.freenode.net

--- Compiling pgserver

This is the extra concice version, see below for more:

 ./autogen.sh
 ./configure
 make menuconfig
 make

You don't need to run "make install" just to use pgserver, but it's helpful
to install pgserver so that client libraries and themetools can access
its header files. If you don't want to install pgserver, you can use
./configure options in themetools and cli_c to point them at your headers.

--- Configuration options

The PicoGUI server supports many compile-time and runtime options :

 - Cross-compiling is achieved through standard GNU ./configure options.
   There are also several custom ./configure options to make it easier to
   integrate PicoGUI into other build systems. Type "./configure --help"
   for more information.

 - The server has numerous options that can be set at compile-time. It uses
   a modified version of the Linux kernel configuration system. Type
   "make menuconfig" to access these.

 - The server has a runtime config system that can be accessed via command
   line options or config files. Take a look at README.configfile for more
   information on the format, and read the output of "pgserver -h" for
   the extra command line options supported.
