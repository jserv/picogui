This is a Pure Python client library for writing PicoGUI client
apps. It doesn't wrap the C client library; it's an independent
reimplementation of the same protocol.

Dependencies

  You need Python 2.2 in a socket-enabled OS. Yes, that's all. You
  don't even need PicoGUI (but you need to have a pgserver that you
  can connect to, not necessarily on the same machine).

Installation

  Somewhere in your python path (see sys.path inside the interactive
  interpreter) there must be a directory named site-packages. Copy or
  symlink the PicoGUI directory there. If you find more than one,
  choose the one that suits you best. For example, in a
  Debian GNU/Linux system you could put it in
  /usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages or
  /usr/local/lib/python2.2/site-packages - then I'd recommend local.

Usage

  There will be a copy of the documentation inside the package, in the
  near future. In the meanwhile, it's a moving target, so this would
  be a waste of efforts. So, read the work-in-progress documentation
  at http://PyPicoGUI.laranja.org:8080/ and the sample scripts.

Examples

  There are some simple example applications written using this client
  libraries in the PicoGUI source distribution, under pg1/apps/test/python.
