These are graphics specifically designed or modified for PicoGUI.
They are in PNM format.

The buttons directory contains 16x16 images with mask for use in buttons.
The bg directory has small tiling backgrounds.
The src directory contains Gimp XCF files used to make the images. (or any
other type of source file used)

Because the default icons and such will soon be built into the server,
this directory is now just a place to put useful images that might be
integrated into the server or that people might use in themes.
