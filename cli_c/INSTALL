* Installation from CVS :
  -----------------------

 1. - run ./autogen.sh *once*, tu setup your autoconf environment.
 2. - from there, proceed as for the tarball installation


* Installation from a tarball archive :
  -------------------------------------

 1. - run the ./configure script, eventually with some options :

	  --help                 for a complete list of options


 3. - Compile the library :

         make

 4. - That's it. You can also use the following make targets for
      various tasks :

	 make clean      to remove compilation objects

	 make distclean  to remove generated files

	 make dist       to create a tar.gz archive of the project

	 make tags       to create a TAG file suitable for use with
			 emacs


* Crosscompilation
  ----------------

  Crosscompiling requires additional parameters for the ./configure
  script. Let's say you want to compile for a host of type
  m68k-pic-coff, from a linux box:

	./configure --host=m68k-pic-coff --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu

  To avoid typing the build platform, it is possible to use

	./configure --host=m68k-pic-coff --build=`./config.guess`

  These operations assume that the gcc/ld/ar commands are actually
  cross-compiling tools. If the cross-tools are called differently,
  they have to be specified as environment variables :

       CC=cross-gcc LD=cross-ld ./configure --host=m68k-pic-coff --build=`./config.guess`

  Usually, the tools are prefixed with the same name as the
  compilation host (ie m68k-pic-coff-gcc). I've provided a shortcut in
  that case :

       ./configure --host=m68k-pic-coff --build=`./config.guess` --with-prefix

  This whole stuff is less a constraint as it appears at first, as the
  configuration is usually done only once. In addition, there is a
  nice counterpart, explained in the next section.


* Multiple compilations
  ---------------------

  It is possible to compile the same source files with different
  configuration options and different pgui settings :

   1. - create a directory somewhere. let's call it uclinux/.

   2. - go in the directory and run

	   /path/to/configure --your-options

   3. - type make there. The makefile will use the sources located
        where the configure script is located.

  You can create as many different directories like that with
  different configuration parameters, which will all check the
  dependencies from the same source files.

  The only constraint is that you cannot compile with this model *and*
  with your objects in the source tree in the same time.

Enjoy !
