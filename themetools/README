PicoGUI Theme Tools
--------------------

This directory contains programs to compile, analyze, or
do anything else with PicoGUI theme files.
The theme file format is defined in:
	pgserver/include/picogui/theme.h
and
	pgserver/include/picogui/constants.h

Right now this is only used with the code in the
theme_overhaul branch of the server. Hopefully I'll update
this README when I merge in the theme code, but I might
forget so by the time you read this the code may have already
been merged. Oh well... If you have any questions email me :)
