This TODO file is loosely modelled after the style used in autopackage.

The red section holds items that I'm going to look at soonish.  

The green section holds items that people have suggested but I don't consider high priority, so
probably won't get done unless I'm sent patches.

RED:
 * If lilo doesn't sort things out on freenode, proper throttling and flood detection
