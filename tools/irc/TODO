This TODO file is loosely modelled after the style used in autopackage.

The red section holds items that I'm going to look at soonish.  

The green section holds items that people have suggested but I don't consider high priority, so
probably won't get done unless I'm sent patches.

RED:
 * Allow the bot to register with NickServ so we don't have to keep re-opping it in #only-commits
 * Allow the bot to op itself on freenode (OPER)
 * BUG: python filter script doesn't strip dupes

GREEN:
 * Make BonsaiBot not suck
