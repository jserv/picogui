<!-- 
  This file holds local modifications to the sources.xml in the
  conf package. It will be automatically modified to save cached
  mirror information, for example.

  Note that if this file is automatically modified, all comments
  and formatting will be lost.

  Also note the inclusion of empty <sites/> and <packages/> tags.
  This is what determines what modifications this file will store.
  (When this is merged with the pgbuild configuration, those empty
   tags set this file as a read-write mount point for sites and
   packages. If we only wanted to define one tree, we could use
   the 'root' attribute on our <pgbuild> tag.)
