This is the top-level directory for PicoGUI's build system.
The only thing specific to PicoGUI is the default list of packages, so feel
free to use this in other projects if it's helpful.

  build.py
    A python script functioning as the build system's entry point. Try
    ./build.py --help for information.

  src/
    Directory containing the source code for the build engine, and where
    sources for other components are automatically downloaded.

  bin/
    Compiled binaries and object files, sorted by architecture.

  conf/
    Configuration files for the build system. This instructs it where
    to download sources from, and stores the user's configuration.
