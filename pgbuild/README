This is the top-level directory for PicoGUI's build system.
The only thing specific to PicoGUI is the default list of packages, so feel
free to use this in other projects if it's helpful.

  build.py
    A python script functioning as the build system's entry point. Try
    ./build.py --help for information.

  src/
    Sources for all packages, including the build system itself and its default
    configuration files.

  bin/
    Compiled binaries and object files, sorted by architecture.

  conf/
    XML Build Configuration files for local modifications to the build system.
    Any files with a .xbc extension are automatically mounted into PGBuild's
    configuration tree. The default files in this directory will store modifications
    made to the build options, package list, or download sites.
