This is the top-level directory for PicoGUI's build system.
The only thing specific to PicoGUI is the default list of packages, so feel
free to use this in other projects if it's helpful.

The only requirement the build system itself has is Python 2.2 or newer.
All other necessary software is either included in this package, or can be
automatically installed ifn ecessary.

Files and directories included within:

  build
    (Python script)
    Convenient build system entry point for operating systems that support
    "#!"-style script execution.

  pgbuild.py
    (Python script)
    Bootstrap pathnames and packagenames for PGBuild, can function as an entry
    point identically to 'build' for operating systems that don't support "#!" lines

  pgbuild-gui.py
    (Python script)
    Yet another entry point, but automatically prepends --gui to all the given
    command line options, causing a graphical interface to be opened. This is for
    the convenience of point-and-click operating systems like Windows and MacOS.

  src/
    Sources for all packages, including the build system itself and its default
    configuration files.

  bin/
    Compiled binaries and object files, sorted by architecture.

  conf/
    XML Build Configuration files for local modifications to the build system.
    Any files with a .xbc extension are automatically mounted into PGBuild's
    configuration tree.
    This directory should be automatically populated with skeleton files
    from the conf-dev package.
