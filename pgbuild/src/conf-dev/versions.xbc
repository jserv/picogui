	<!-- 
	Version groups are a convenience for managing large sets of packages
	that are usually released under a single version number, and stored
	in the same relative location for each version release.
	Package definitions can use a tag of the form:
		<versiongroup name="Name" path="Path">
	to refer to a version group defined here. The 'path' attribute will be
	joined to all URIs specified by the version group.

	Note that <version> tags in the <versiongroup> are processed just like
	<version> tags in the package itself, so versiongroups can be nested.
	-->

	<!--
	Group for all packages following the shared PicoGUI version numbering scheme.
	This doesn't include sources from before the SVN migration-
	those are in the 'legacy' package.
