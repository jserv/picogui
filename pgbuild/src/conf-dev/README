This is the 'conf' package, responsible for bootstrapping
PGBuild's configuration database with project-specific data.
Any XML Build Configuration files (.xbc extension) in this
directory are automatically loaded by PGBuild before
any others.

If you choose to use PGBuild on a different project, this
conf package should be all you need to change.
