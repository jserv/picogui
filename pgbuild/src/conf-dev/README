This is the 'conf' package, responsible for bootstrapping
PGBuild's configuration database with project-specific data.
Files in this directory are 'mounted' into the config
database first.

It also contains XSL and CSS stylesheets so that the
configuration defaults can be displayed in an easy to read
form in an XSLT-compatible web browser or with XSLT
preprocessing.
