  Defines the sites and packages for the PicoGUI repository.

  This is a PGBuild config file: XML, with an additional twist-
  any tags with the same parent, name, and attributes are merged
  into one tag, with child nodes of both concatenated and
  recursively merged. This makes PGBuild's concept of configuration
  'mount points' useful.

  <!--
    Packages are groups of files that are conditionally downloaded,
    then independently updated. Packages can be comprised of any
    number of versions- this lets you provide packages of the latest
    development code in addition to all releases. Each version always
    has a single download location, relative to a site. Mirrors are
    described using the site definitions above.
       
    Package names can not contain dashes, since a dash separates
    package name and version in pgbuild's working copy.

    <!--
      The source code for pgbuild. This is included in the initial download
      of pgbuild for obvious reasons, but it is also a package, so it can
      be automatically updated just like any other package.

      <!--
        The <require/> tag forces pgbuild to keep this package installed
        and to keep its configuration database loaded. Here it is used since
        pgbuild needs itself for the build process :)
      -->
      <require/>
    </package>

    <!--
      The default configuration files for pgbuild are in a separate package,
      for a couple reasons:
      
      1. If you use pgbuild in a separate project, you can specify your own
         site for the conf package's source, while leaving build pointing
         at PicoGUI's site. This way you continue to recieve automatic updates
         to pgbuild itself.
      
      2. If the configuration files are being updated frequently, only a small
         conf package has to be downloaded, rather than a possibly much larger
         package if conf is combined with the pgbuild source.
    -->
    <package name="conf">
      <version name="dev">
         <a href="trunk/pgbuild/src/conf-dev" ><site name="picogui-svn" /></a>
      </version>

      <!--
        The require tag is needed here because the conf package's configuration
        is the starting point from which all other packages can be loaded.
