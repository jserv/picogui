        Construct a new scanner object given a scanner function.

        'function' - a scanner function taking two or three
        arguments and returning a list of strings.

        'name' - a name for identifying this scanner object.

        'argument' - an optional argument that, if specified, will be
        passed to both the scanner function and the path_function.

        'skeys' - an optional list argument that can be used to determine
        which scanner should be used for a given Node. In the case of File
        nodes, for example, the 'skeys' would be file suffixes.

        'path_function' - a function that takes one to three arguments
        (a construction environment, optional directory, and optional
        argument for this instance) and returns a tuple of the
        directories that can be searched for implicit dependency files.

        'node_class' - the class of Nodes which this scan will return.
        If node_class is None, then this scanner will not enforce any
        Node conversion and will return the raw results from the
        underlying scanner function.

        'node_factory' - the factory function to be called to translate
        the raw results returned by the scanner function into the
        expected node_class objects.

        'scan_check' - a function to be called to first check whether
        this node really needs to be scanned.

        'recursive' - specifies that this scanner should be invoked
        recursively on the implicit dependencies it returns (the
        canonical example being #include lines in C source files).

        The scanner function's first argument will be the name of a file
        that should be scanned for dependencies, the second argument will
        be an Environment object, the third argument will be the value
        passed into 'argument', and the returned list should contain the
        Nodes for all the direct dependencies of the file.

        Examples:

        s = Scanner(my_scanner_function)

        s = Scanner(function = my_scanner_function)

        s = Scanner(function = my_scanner_function, argument = 'foo')
