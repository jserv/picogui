This directory is expected to be in the python path when
using PGBuild. It is comprised of sources from multiple locations:

  - SCons
    v0.13

    This module provides the SCons build system that PGBuild is
    layered on top of. See http://scons.sourceforge.net/

  - dmutil, PyBison
    v0.1

    These modules are for the PyXPath parser. The XML XPath
    language is used extensively in PGBuild's configuration system.
    See http://www.handshake.de/~dieter/pyprojects/pyxpath.html

  - PGBuild
    dev

    This directory contains the new code for the PGBuild system.
    It is maintained in-place in the PicoGUI repository.
