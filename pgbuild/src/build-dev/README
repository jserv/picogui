This directory is expected to be at the beginning of the python
path when using PGBuild. It is comprised of sources from
multiple locations:

  - SCons
    v0.14

    This module provides the SCons build system that PGBuild is
    layered on top of. See http://scons.sourceforge.net/

  - dmutil, PyBison
    v0.1 - modified

    These modules are for the PyXPath parser. The XML XPath
    language is used extensively in PGBuild's configuration system.
    See http://www.handshake.de/~dieter/pyprojects/pyxpath.html

    This package has been hacked up a bit to work correctly with
    the minidom instead of a full DOM implementation.

  - optik
    v1.4.1

    The command line frontend for PGBuild uses Optik as its command
    line parser. Note that SCons already includes a copy of Optik,
    but it's been modified.
    See http://optik.sourceforge.net/

  - xml
    Python 2.2.2 - modified

    This is a copy of the xml module from Python 2.2.2.
    It has been modified to not attempt loading the xmlplus module.
    This is here to work around a bug in some versions of Gentoo
    Linux where the xmlplus module is broken. Previously I had been
    using a less drastic workaround for the bug, but it caused
    an annoying delay at startup.

  - tarfile.py
    v0.6.6

    The tarfile module is a pure python implementation of 'tar', used
    to portably extract packages distributed in .tar.bz2 and .tar.gz files.
    Note that this module will be built in with Python 2.3, but we include
    it to stay compatible with Python 2.2.
    See http://www.gustaebel.de/lars/tarfile/

  - maplist.py
    v0.9

    The maplist module is a container that works like a dictionary but
    preserves the ordering of elements, and provides some Set behavior.
    The set operations provided by this module are required by the package
    management code.
    See http://www.scriptfoundry.com/modules/maplist/

  - PGBuild
    dev

    This directory contains the new code for the PGBuild system.
    It is maintained in-place in the PicoGUI repository.
