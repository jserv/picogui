This directory is expected to be at the beginning of the python
path when using PGBuild. It is comprised of sources from
multiple locations:

  - SCons
    v0.13

    This module provides the SCons build system that PGBuild is
    layered on top of. See http://scons.sourceforge.net/

  - dmutil, PyBison
    v0.1 - modified

    These modules are for the PyXPath parser. The XML XPath
    language is used extensively in PGBuild's configuration system.
    See http://www.handshake.de/~dieter/pyprojects/pyxpath.html

    This package has been hacked up a bit to work correctly with
    the minidom instead of a full DOM implementation.

  - optik
    v1.4.1

    The command line frontend for PGBuild uses Optik as its command
    line parser. Note that SCons already includes a copy of Optik,
    but it's been modified.
    See http://optik.sourceforge.net/

  - PGBuild
    dev

    This directory contains the new code for the PGBuild system.
    It is maintained in-place in the PicoGUI repository.
