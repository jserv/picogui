This is a small typing program for PicoGUI.
I'm building it both as an educational tool,
and as a test of PicoGUI's capabilities.

Because this program wants to take over the
whole screen, it isn't designed to use the
appmgr to cooperate with other apps. I'll
save a demonstration of this for a different
proggie.

For best results, run this with a 640x480
full-screen pgserver
