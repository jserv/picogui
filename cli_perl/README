This is the beginnings of the first client-side library for PicoGUI.
Unlike the server that is released under the GPL, the client library
is LGPL'ed.  This allows non-free programs to connect to the server
in the same standard way, instead of having to devise some non-standard
way of doing so.

This version of the client library is a Perl module.  Why perl?
This client library is mainly for testing purposes.  I might change
many aspects of it before the "real" standard client-side interface.
I chose perl because I like it for writing testbed apps and
rapid-prototyping of programs that don't need to be blazing fast.

Included also are many example programs.  I leave it as an excersize to
the reader to determine how/why they work.  :)
