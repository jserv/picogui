This perl library is completely rewritten. It now aims to create an interface
for perl that exactly mirrors the one for C, and uses the C client library.

Note: This is my first attempt at an XS module, so please let me know where
i messed up ;)

-------------------- Quick and inadequate documentation

For the most part, the perl client library is just like the C client lib.
The following lists all exceptions to this rule:

- The *Fmt functions like pgMessageDialogFmt are not implemented because
  they are unnecessary in perl
  
- Functions that accept a variable-length param list do not need to specify
  the number of args (pgWriteCmd) or zero-terminate the list (pgSetWidget
  and others)
  
- Trailing optional parameters (like in pgNewWidget) may be omitted

- pgInit is called automatically, but does not yet support command-line
  arguments (you can still set the server using the pgserver environment var)

- pgRegisterApp does not support APPSPEC parameters yet

- pgBind's 'extra' parameter is not supported because it is used
  internally to associate the C event handler and Perl event handler

- pgFrom* are gone, and pgmemdata has been replaced by a simple string scalar

- The folowing functions are unsupported so far but are planned:

pgSetErrorHandler
pgSetIdle
pgCustomizeSelect
pgGetVideoMode
pgSetWidget
pgNewBitmap
pgSizeText
pgLoadTheme
pgWriteData

** The End **
