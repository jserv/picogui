Much of PicoGUI's documentation is (will be?) built directly from the
source code.  The scripts used to do this are in the 'src' directory.
Generated documentation is sorted by file format.

Software necessary to rebuild the documentation:

- cinclude2dot (http://www.chaosreigns.com/code/cinclude2dot/)
  This is used to build a confusing but interesting graph of the
  server's include file structure

- Graphvis (http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/)
  Needed by cinclude2dot, and it is used for producing the theme object
  inheritance diagram

- Perl (You should already have this!)
  cinclude2dot needs perl, and the various scripts in 'src' are written in
  perl.
