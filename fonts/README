PicoGUI Freetype Font Package
-----------------------------

This is a set of core fonts to use with PicoGUI's Freetype font backend.
It contains fonts taken from various sources, documented below. All the
original licenses are included in the LICENSE.* files in this directory. As
far as I know there is no problem distributing these with GPL'ed software,
if you know otherwise please let me know (micahjd@users.sourceforge.net)

Hopefully this will form a base set of fonts for themes and defaults to
refer to, and to be included in most products using PicoGUI and Freetype.

Note that this directory also includes font.index, for fast loading.
Assuming you installed this font package at /usr/share/picogui/fonts, you
could use the following lines in your pgserver.conf to use the index:

[font-freetype]
path = /usr/share/picogui/fonts
scan_list = /usr/share/picogui/fonts/font.index
