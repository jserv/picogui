PicoGUI Freetype Font Package
-----------------------------

This is a set of core fonts to use with PicoGUI's Freetype font backend.
It contains fonts taken from OpenOffice, Ghostscript, and X11. They are
all licensed in a GPL-compatible way as far as I know.

Hopefully this will form a base set of fonts for themes and defaults to
refer to, and to be included in most products using PicoGUI and Freetype.

Note that this directory also includes font.index, for fast loading.
Assuming you installed this font package at /usr/share/picogui/fonts, you
could use the following lines in your pgserver.conf to use the index:

[font-freetype]
path = /usr/share/picogui/fonts
scan_list = /usr/share/picogui/fonts/font.index

-------------- Contents:

  - Helmet
    From OpenOffice, a good general-purpose sans-serif font
    
  - Timmons
    From OpenOffice, a general purpose serif font
    
  - Nimbus Mono L
    From Ghostscript, a scalable monospaced font
    
  - Clean (6,8,12)
    From X11, a bitmapped font that works nicely for
    terminals at small sizes
