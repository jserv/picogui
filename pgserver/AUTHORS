  This AUTHORS file uses mostly the same format as Linux's CREDITS file.
  It is sorted alphabetically by name, formatted for both machine
  and human readability. The fields are: name (N), email address (E),
  web address (W), PGP key ID and fingerprint (P), description (D),
  snail-mail address (S), instant messaging address (I).
  
  Feel free to add yourself to this, whether you rewrote all of pgserver
  in a weekend, wrote documentation, or made a 1-line bugfix to someone else's
  app.
