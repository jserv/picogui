Now we have yet another platform on which PicoGUI works very nicely !

I have tweaked Xcopilot to have a 320x240 lcd panel. Later I'll introduce some
simple skinning features so that the lcd, digi, and case dimensions can be
read from ~/.xcopilot/config, with some image file for the case. So for now,
the ChipSlice-ization of Xcopilot is hard-coded. It is chosen by the
CONFIG_SOFT_CHIPSLICE symbol. The lcd panel and the digi area have exactly the
same size.

	* config.in: Added the SOFT_CHIPSLICE target

	* input/tsinput.c: Added settings for the geometry of SOFT_CHIPSLICE

	* video/ez328.c:  Added settings for the geometry of SOFT_CHIPSLICE

	* config.in: Supports XCOPILOT as target
	
	* debug/videotest.c: Tests can run in a loop and/or cycle
	
	* include/pgserver/mc68328digi.h: New version to reflect drivers
	changes in the kernel

	* input/tsinput.c: Ditto

	* video/ez328.c: Works with XCOPILOT
