	* SMARTDATA.config: removed
	* SMARTDATA-vz.config: added
	Renamed SMARTDATA.config to SMARTDATA-vz.config to ease the automatic
	multi-platform builds.


2001-06-21    Pascal Bauermeister <pascal.bauermeister@smartdata.ch>
	* configure.in Makefile.am input/tsinput.c:
	Removed hard-coded paths related to resource manager and uClinux. Now,
	extra include paths and extra libraries can be added via configure
	options:
	  --with-extra-ipath=...  --with-extra-lpath=... --with-extra-libs=...
	They must be specified so that the rm.h, mc68328digi.h and librm.a
	can be found.

2001-06-04    Pascal Bauermeister <pascal.bauermeister@smartdata.ch>
	* input/tsinput.c: Added two arguments in PG_TS_CALIBRATION to set
	the pointer shift

	* appmgr/global.c: Big cursor for ChipSlice !

	* SMARTDATA-soft.config SMARTDATA.config: Latest Smartdata config


2001-05-29    Pascal Bauermeister <pascal.bauermeister@smartdata.ch>
	* video/ez328.c: CONFIG_SOFT_CHIPSLICE shares the same bug as
	Xcopilot: restoring of LCD registers have to be skipped


2001-04-12    Pascal Bauermeister <pascal.bauermeister@smartdata.ch>

	* vidbase/linear1.c vidbase/linear2.c vidbase/linear3.c:
	added handling for CONFIG_ROTATE180

	* SMARTDATA.config: updated config

	* appmgr/global.c: reverted to old cursor

Added support for video 180 degree rotation. This is provided as an option in
the config. When selected, the whole display is rotated by 180 degree (any
time, and not under control of applications). Aadditional 90 degree is still
possible, of course. This is for the case the display is rotated physically
(for mechanical/construction reasons).

It could be done by inserting a wrapper in the linear driver that intercepts
function calls and modifies their geometry parameters. The matter of one
effective lines of code per function. This illustrates the cool design PicoGUI,
need I say more ?  As mentionned, this is a compile-time option (alright, if
someone wants to port MAME ;-) and support cocktail mode, just make it a
dynamic option).

Currently only the linear1 driver is done.

	* config.in config.help: added option CONFIG_ROTATE180

	* vidbase/linear1.c: added handling for CONFIG_ROTATE180

Now we have yet another platform on which PicoGUI works very nicely !

I have tweaked Xcopilot to have a 320x240 lcd panel. Later I'll introduce some
simple skinning features so that the lcd, digi, and case dimensions can be
read from ~/.xcopilot/config, with some image file for the case. So for now,
the ChipSlice-ization of Xcopilot is hard-coded. It is chosen by the
CONFIG_SOFT_CHIPSLICE symbol. The lcd panel and the digi area have exactly the
same size.

	* config.in: Added the SOFT_CHIPSLICE target

	* input/tsinput.c: Added settings for the geometry of SOFT_CHIPSLICE

	* video/ez328.c:  Added settings for the geometry of SOFT_CHIPSLICE

	
2001-03-19    Pascal Bauermeister <pascal.bauermeister@smartdata.ch>

	* config.in: Supports XCOPILOT as target
	
	* debug/videotest.c: Tests can run in a loop and/or cycle
	
	* include/pgserver/mc68328digi.h: New version to reflect drivers
	changes in the kernel

	* input/tsinput.c: Ditto

	* video/ez328.c: Works with XCOPILOT
