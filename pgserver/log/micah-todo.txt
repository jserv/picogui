PicoGUI Bugs
-------------------------------

- scrolling
- FIXMEs
- retest all video drivers
- tiled blit() src_x and src_y ignored in most drivers
- tileblit() hangs in linear8
- pgGetText of non-text handles crashes server
- memory leak (doesn't delete app_info)
- Deleting a handle returned from WP_TEXT of a field crashes the server. Need
  a way to mark a handle as readable by app but not deletable.
- Fix ncurses bug in makefile
- Themes aren't necessarily loaded back in the right order when increasing bpp
