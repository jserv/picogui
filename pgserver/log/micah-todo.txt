PicoGUI Bugs
-------------------------------

- FIXMEs
- retest all video drivers
- pgGetText of non-text handles crashes server
- memory leak (doesn't delete app_info)
- Deleting a handle returned from WP_TEXT of a field crashes the server. Need
  a way to mark a handle as readable by app but not deletable.
- Themes aren't necessarily loaded back in the right order when increasing bpp
- Misc server crashes with gremlins
- Clicking a panelbar in solid mode doesn't shade/unshade it
- A new command prompt appears each time pterm is resized
- Fragments of the mouse cursor appear on the panelbar sometimes when it
  is dragged in sprite drag mode.
