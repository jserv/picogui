Some functions directly connected to the hardware like the 'sleep mode' are
made by the bios and accessed from userland through the Ressources Manager

	* tsinput.c: - add Ressources Manager call for sleep mode
		         rm_init();
		         rm_exit ();
		         rm_sleep(RM_WAKE_ON_BUTTON);
		     - disable xy swapping for XCopilot environment
		         ts_params.xy_swap        = 0;
