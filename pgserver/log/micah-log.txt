Well, I'm on spring break now! So, aside from the multiplayer gaming, I have
plenty of time to code :)

      * vidbase/defaultvbl.c: Fixed charblit_u clipping
      
      * Removed some obsolete themes

Cleaning up a few remaining issues... After that, I'm planning on
implementing the necessary bitmap conversions to make depth switching work
right. With all these things that can now be changed at runtime it would be
nice to make some sort of menu to do it from. Ah, that's what pgl was going
to be for :)

      * config.defaults: Updated defaults, including rotation on by default
            
      * gcore/pgmain.c: Added -r command line option to rotate by default
      
      * vidwrap/rotate90.c: Now checks whether cursor is allocated before
        rotating it, this prevents segfault with -r flag.

      * include/pgserver/handle.h: Changed return type of handle_iterate to
        g_error from void
	
      * gcore/handle.c: Made changes necessary for handle_iterate to return
        errors from iterator functions.

      * vidwrap_rotate90.c: Added error checking to rotate90_entermode

      * include/pgserver/video.h: Made charblit_u conditionally compile;
        only needed when CONFIG_ROTATE is on
	
      * vidwrap/rotate90.c: Rotated charblit_v now uses charblit_u
	
      * vidbase/defaultvbl.c: Adding a reference implementation of charblit_u

Happy Friday! (my last day of school before spring break)
I'm cleaning up the aftermath of yesterday's hasty rotation coding. This
includes fixing remaining bugs, and integrating the changes into video
drivers other than sdlfb and ez328.

      * gcore/video.c: A small bug in the root divnode resizing loop prevented
        layers other than the bottom one from updating. Now the screen can be
	resized/rotated while a menu or dialog is onscreen.
	
      * widget/popup.c: Separated popup clipping code into the new
        clip_popup() function

      * include/pgserver/widget.h: Added clip_popup()
      
      * gcore/video.c: Added code to clip any onscreen popups so they don't
        redraw past the edge of the screen and segfault
	
      * include/pgserver/divtree.h: Changed the 'split' variable to a signed
        16-bit integer to avoid problems with wrap-around

      * video/ncurses.c: Removed mode parameters from it's init function
      
      * video/null.c: Removed params from init, added a dummy setmode()

      * appmgr/global.c: Fixed memory leak. Default cursor bitmaps were not
        getting freed on shutdown

      * include/pgserver/video.h: Added charblit_u function for upside-down
        text blits (rotated charblit_v)

Shortly after committing the rotation code with runtime mode switching, I
found a few bugs...
      
      * vidbase/defaultvbl.c: Fixed some faulty logic in
        def_bitmap_rotate90() that broke rotation in modes less than 8bpp
