PicoGUI Applications
--------------------

Here you shall find the 'real' applications for PicoGUI.
Testbed apps and simple tests are in pgui/cli_c/demos.

To compile these, you must have the client library installed.
Make sure you have the cli_c directory from the source tree,
and run 'make install' as root to install headers and the
library.
