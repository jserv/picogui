This is a very simple app that - as per Micah's suggestion - creates
seven buttons, assigns hotkeys for them corresponding to the keyboard
events generated by the vr3 silkscreen buttons, then sits there
without mapping anything to the screen.

It's not configurable yet. To change the commands run by the buttons,
edit commands.h and recompile. Sorry :-) I'm not a C person.
