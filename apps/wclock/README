wclock
======
wclock (AKA WorldClock) displays (almost) all time zones on a world
map. This is a PicoGUI application (http://pgui.sourceforge.net/).

Currently it should only compile on unix, because the build of some
map-related files require shell-script features in the Makefile.

It should run one day on handheld devices, but it has been currently
only tested on PC. Some more work is needed regarding display size,
color depth and speed for handhelds. See TODO.

History of the project
======================
- Implemented on Amiga (long ago). Special ad-hoc maps compression.
- Re-implemented as a Java applet.
- Re-implemented on PicoGUI.
