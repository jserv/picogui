A quick port of the Agenda QuickWriting app to PicoGUI. See the Agenda
QuickWriting app home page (http://agtoys.sourceforge.net/aqw/aqw.html)
for documentation. The original README file for that program has been
renamed README.orig

Apart from replacing the GUI code I changed a couple of things. The
code has moved from C++ to C (fairly trivially). The cursor buttons to
the left are also new, as is the method of calculating which zone the
cursor is in. The orriginal calculated a distance from the centre and
angle using sqrt(), and atan2(). This seemed a bit slow on the agenda
so I replaced it with some slightly faster logic plus a lookup table. I
actually think the bottleneck is pgserver passing the mouse movement
through to the client, so this is probably completely unnecessary.
