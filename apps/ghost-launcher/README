Start apps based on user clicking "invisible buttons".

This is intended to be used for starting apps based on tapping
silkscreen "buttons" in PDAs.

The config file is /etc/ghost-launcher.conf, and is line-based. Each line is:
x1 x2 y1 y2 type commandline

The "type" argument is always 0 for running a command. It's planned
that it will have other possible values in the future, for
showing/hiding the keyboard or displaying a menu, for example.
