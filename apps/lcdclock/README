These are some utility programs I use with my now-PicoGUI-powered LCD
wall clock. It is a 40x4 character LCD with a Hitachi HD44780 controller
and a PIC16C84 microcontroller to interface it to my desktop computer's
serial port. The PIC runs the program included in pgserver's source as
video/serial40x4.firmware.c compiled with the 'c2c' compiler. The desktop
computer needs to have a serial port configured for 9600 baud symlinked to
/dev/lcd, and a pgserver running with the serial40x4 driver and text_lcd.th
theme.

The included lcdclock.c program displays a clock in large numbers on the
left half of the LCD. The right half is left open for other PicoGUI
connections, which may be from various system monitor modules or anything
else. Message dialogs show up full-screen on the LCD. Console programs run
nicely using pterm.

The LCD also has an LED it can flash, and a small beeper. Both were used
by the previous software (all written in perl) to indicate network errors
and such, but aren't yet used by PicoGUI.
