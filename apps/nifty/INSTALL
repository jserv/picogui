Copy, move or symlink the Nifty directory to somewhere in
your PYTHONPATH (/usr/local/lib/python2.3 for example).

Copy, move or symlink nifty.py to somewhere in your PATH
(/usr/local/bin for example).

I promise to include a setup.py file in the near future, if
Micah doesn't beat me to it by moving the whole PicoGUI
build system to SCons.
