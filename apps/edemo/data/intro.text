This is a small application intended to give you a quick tour of PicoGUI's main features.

PicoGUI is a new type of user interface tool: It does far more than a pure widget set does. It's client/server, but not like X. It has themes, but they do far more than any other system's themes. PicoGUI is a system, designed for simplicity, flexibility, and individuality.

(More will be added here later... for now, sit back and enjoy the shiny widgets)
