Popup boxes work. Combination text/bitmap buttons work. Many speed
enhancements in networking. Still a bug with S_ALL and buttons, but
next on my feature list is scrolling, composite widgets, and (tada!) the
text edit widget (with support for HTML and other cool stuff). Still
works in Linux and windoze with SDL, and the SVGAlib driver is in progress.
Haven't started the 68EZ328 driver yet.
