Well, as you might have seen from the recent screenshots, PicoGUI's popup
menus and panelbars work! Therse were the two biggest gaps that needed
filling before PicoGUI can actually run things. Now it should be possible to
build a toolbar for launching and monitoring applications. Of course without
a multiline text editor the usefulness is limited, but we're getting there!
