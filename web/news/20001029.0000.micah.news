I added a tiny sprite engine to generalize the process of overlaying stuff
on top of the screen. This is now used for dragging (such as the panelbar)
and the mouse cursor. Now that PicoGUI can draw its own mouse cursor, I was
able to finish the SVGAlib driver. It needs more optimization, and mode
switching isn't implemented, but it works-
so, I'll try to put it on a disk with a kernel :)
