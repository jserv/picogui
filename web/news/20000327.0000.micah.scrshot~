Before PicoGUI was PicoGUI, it was "guwi", the GUI I was designing for the
<a href="http://kiwi.sourceforge.net">Kiwi Project</a>. I still intent
to use PicoGUI for Kiwi, but it turned into something unique and capable
enough that I thought it deserved its own identity. :)<br>
PicoGUI (well, "guwi") was officially started on March 17, 2000. It's early
history can be found in the <a href="http://kiwi.sourceforge.net/attic.html">
Kiwi attic</a>. The example above is
the last screenshot taken while it was still "guwi".
