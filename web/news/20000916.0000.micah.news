Philippe Ney was first to post actual code for the client lib. His demo
prog made a sucessful connection to the server, and sent some packets. I
cleaned up the code, debugged it, and added a handful of new features last
night. I have the design for the new theme system planned out but I'm only
starting to implement it. Find the new client lib in the cli_c directory (on
CVS of course) and the theme code I'm working on will soon be on the
theme_overhaul branch of the pgserver CVS.
<br>BTW, we're actually using the mailing list now! Woohoo!
