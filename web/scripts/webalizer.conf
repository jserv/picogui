# This is a sample configuration file for the Webalizer (ver 1.30)
# Lines starting with pound signs '#' are comment lines and are
# ignored.  Blank lines are skipped as well.  Other lines are considered
# as configuration lines, and have the form "ConfigOption  Value" where
# ConfigOption is a valid configuration keyword, and Value is the value
# to assign that configuration option.  Invalid keyword/values are
# ignored, with appropriate warnings being displayed.  There must be
# at least one space or tab between the keyword and its value.
#
# As of version 0.98, The Webalizer will look for a 'default'
# configuration
# file named "webalizer.conf" in the current directory, and if not found
# there, will look for "/etc/webalizer.conf".

# LogFile defines the web server log file to use.  If not specified
# here or on on the command line, input will default to STDIN.
# projectname has to be changed to your real unix project name.

LogFile        /home/groups/pgui/log/access_log

# OutputDir is where you want to put the output files.  This should
# should be a full path name, however relative ones might work as well.
# If no output directory is specified, the current directory will be
# used.
# projectname has to be changed to your real unix project name.

OutputDir      /home/groups/pgui/htdocs/webalizer

# HostName defines the hostname for the report.  This is used in
# the title, and is prepended to the URL table items.  This allows
# clicking on URL's in the report to go to the proper location in
# the event you are running the report on a 'virtual' web server,
# or for a server different than the one the report resides on.
# If not specified here, or on the command line, webalizer will
# try to get the hostname via a uname system call.  If that fails,
# it will default to "localhost".
# projectname has to be changed to your real unix project name.

HostName       pgui.sourceforge.net

# HTMLExtension allows you to specify the filename extension to use
# for generated HTML pages.  Normally, this defaults to "html", but
# can be changed for sites who need it (like for PHP embeded pages).
# html has to be set to php if you use PHP embeded pages

HTMLExtension  html

# PageType lets you tell the Webalizer what types of URL's you
# consider a 'page'.  Most people consider html and cgi documents
# as pages, while not images and audio files.  If no types are
# specified, defaults will be used ('htm*', 'cgi' and HTMLExtension
# if different).
# lines containing the statments php3 or php have to be
# uncommented if you use PHP embeded pages

# The Ignore* keywords allow you to completely ignore log records based
# on hostname, URL, user agent or referrer.  I hessitated in adding these,
# since the Webalizer was designed to generate _accurate_ statistics
# about a web servers performance.  By choosing to ignore records, the
# accuracy of reports become skewed, negating why I wrote this program
# in the first place.  However, due to popular demand, here they are.
# Use the same as the Hide*/Group* keywords, where the value can have a
# leading or trailing wildcard '*'.

#IgnoreSite     bad.site.net
IgnoreURL       /webalizer*

# End of configuration file...  Have a nice day!
