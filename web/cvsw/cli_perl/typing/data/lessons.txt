: History of perl
# Excerpted from Chapter 8 of Programming Perl
In order to understand why Perl is defined the way it is (or isn't),
one must first understand why Perl even exists. So, let's drag out the
old dusty history book...
Way back in 1986, Larry was a systems programmer on a project that was
developing multi-level-secure wide-area networks.  He was in charge of
an installation consisting of three Vaxen and three Suns on the West
Coast, connected over an encrypted, 1200-baud serial line to a similar
configuration on the East Coast.  Since Larry's primary job was
support (he wasn't a programmer on the project, just the system guru),
he was able to exploit his three virtues (laziness, impatience, and
hubris) to develop and enhance all sorts of useful tools--such as rn,
patch, and warp.
